# Movie Roulette ![alt text](images/rouletteWheel.png)

## Description

Ever have the issue of spending hours upon hours searching through all of your streaming services for a movie that catches your eye?

Movie Roulette can help!

Our app asks you for a list of your available streaming services and the desired genre, then randomly selects a movie for you based on these criteria.

## Technologies Used

This app was created with:

- React v18.2
- SurveyJS (for React) v1.9.129
- Express v4.18.2
- Axios v1.6.7
- Node v20.5
- Npm v9.8.1
- Webpack v5.90.1
- Streaming Availability API v3.3.1 (via RapidAPI)

## Get Started

To get started, first navigate to the directory where this project is stored and run:

```
npm install
```

Next, run:

```
npm run start
```

This will initiate a webpack build command to bundle the application and, subsequently, a node command to start the server.

Finally, open a window to http://localhost:3000 to view the app!

## How to Use

In order to keep with our promise of saving you time in choosing a movie, we have kept the process a simple as possible.

Please select all streaming services of which you have access/membership to with the tagbox titled "Select all streaming services to search".

Then, select the genre of movie you want to watch with the selector titled "Select movie genre".

Once all fields have been filed out, click the "Complete" button and a movie will be randomly selected for you and shown below the form!
